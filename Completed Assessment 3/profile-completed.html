<p>
    I have had many career goals over years, dating back to Junior High. Between wanting
    to be medical doctor to trying my hand at streaming on Twitch, I have found myself turning
    over rocks to find what to set my aim on now. Most recently, learning to code and be a good manager
    has caught my eye. I am currently working through getting my MBA and software development certifice from Devmountain.
    The end goal is to start in back-end development then become a manager at a software company.
    The best part is, finishing this website right here gets me on step closer!
